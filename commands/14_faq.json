Everything else is illegal and we will not offer you support.\n**Can I get the beta for free?**\nRead above.\n**Can I get music functions without beta?**\nRead above.\n**Does DBM support Steam Family Sharing?**\nUnfortunately, we do not support family sharing.\n**Is DBM supported on MacOS or Linux?**\nWe do not support any other platform than Windows. Learn more by doing `!info mac` in <#407233336335925249>.\n**When is the next update? / Where is the developer? / Is this project dead?**\nDiscord Bot Maker was never supposed to be a long-term project. Therefore, the developer decided to stop working on DBM. Please do not expect an update any time soon. You can use modifications to get more options.\n**How can I keep my bot running 24/7?**\nFirst of all, if you close DBM your bot will go offline. You can export your bot and start it using your command line but it will turn off if you shut down your computer. To keep your bot running 24/7 you need to rent a so called Virtual Private Server (VPS). You can either pay for a VPS or find one for free. There are a few suggestions (with tutorials), just do `!info vps` in <#407233336335925249>.",
